1.What database models do you know?
-hierarchical model
-network model
-relational model
-entity-relational model
-object model
-document model
-star schema

2. Which are the main functions performed by a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)?
- The main functions are: Creating/altering/deleting tables and relationships between them (database schema), 
adding, changing, deleting, searching and retrieving of data stored in the tables. Support for the SQL language. 
Tranzaction management(optional).

3. Define what is "table" in database terms. 
- Table is set of data elements (values) that is organized using a model of vertical columns (identified by their name) and horizontal rows, the cell is the unit where a row and column intersect.

4. Explain the differences between a primary and a foreign key.
- The primary key is a column of the table that uniquely identifies its rows, while the foreign key is an identifier of a record located in another table (usually its primary key).

5. Explain the different kinds of relationships between tables in relational databases.
- Relationships between tables are based on interconnections: primary key / foreign key
 Types: 
 - One-to-many: A single record in the first table has many corresponding records in the second table. Used very often.
 - Many-to-many: Records in the first table have many corresponding records in the second one and vice versa.
 - One-to-one: A single record in a table corresponds to a single record in the other table.
 
 6.When is a certain database schema normalized? What are the advantages of normalized databases?
 - Normalization of the relational schema removes repeating data.Non-normalized schemas can contain many data repetitions.

 7. What are database integrity constraints and when are they used?
- The integrity constraints ensure data integrity in the database tables. 

8. Point out the pros and cons of using indexes in a database.
- Indices speed up searching of values in a certain column or group of columns. This is usually implemented by B-trees. Adding and deleting records in indexed tables is slower!

9. What's the main purpose of the SQL language?
- SQL language is standardized declarative language for manipulation of relational databases.

10. What are transactions used for? Give an example.
- Sequence of database operations which are executed as a single unit: Either all of them executes successfully, or non of them executes! As an example we can assume if we want to make transfer from one account into another, if either the withdrawal or the deposit fails the entire operation should be cancelled.

11. What is a NoSQL database?
- Use document-base model.

12. Explain the classical non-relational data models.
- Document model: Set of documents, JSON strings for exapmle.
- Key-value model: Set of key-value pairs.
- Hierarchical key-value: Hierarchy of key-value pairs.
- Wide-column model: Key-value model with schema.
- Object model: Set  of OOP-style objects.

13. Give a few examples of NoSQL databases and their pros and cons.
- Highly optimized for append / retrieve;
- Great performance and scalability;
